// Command Task

/*
Command
The command function shall accept a pointer to void with a return of void.
The pointer in the task argument will be re-cast as a pointer to the command taskâ€™s data
structure type before it can be dereferenced.
The task shall be scheduled whenever a command has been received by the system or
when an outgoing message must be formatted in preparation for transmission to the
remote computer.
*/

/*
Receive
When a command has been received by the system, the task must verify that the
received message is valid. If valid, it is acted upon; if invalid, an error response must
be sent to the SatelliteComms task.
The legal commands and their interpretation are specified in Appendix C.
Transmit
When a message is to be transmitted, the Command task must build the message
body. The message body is then sent to the SatelliteComms task for transmission.
After the message has been interpreted and verified as correct or an outgoing message has
been built and forwarded to the SatelliteComms task, the Command task shall be deleted
